# Execution and paper trading

## Paper trading first
Paper trade for 4 to 8 weeks.
Store:
- Timestamp, market, odds, stake suggestion
- Closing odds
- Outcome
- Notes on lineup changes

## Live execution
Start with:
- Flat stakes
- Hard caps per match and per day
- Strict edge threshold

## Exchanges vs sportsbooks
- Exchanges:
  - Lower friction, easier CLV definition
  - Liquidity can be thin on props
- Sportsbooks:
  - More liquidity, higher margin
  - Limits and restrictions risk

## Safety rules
- Stop if:
  - CLV turns negative for a sustained period
  - Data completeness drops
  - Mapping errors exceed threshold
