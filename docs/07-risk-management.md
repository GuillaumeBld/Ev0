# Risk management

## Bankroll management
- Use flat stakes initially.
- Consider fractional Kelly only after calibration is stable.

## Exposure limits
- Max stake per match
- Max stake per team per day
- Max stake per league per day

## Correlation controls
- Avoid stacking multiple players from the same team in the same match without adjustment.
- Consider a team-level exposure cap.
- Consider reducing stake when multiple bets share the same match-level drivers.

## Model risk
- Use conservative edge thresholds.
- Add uncertainty bands and widen thresholds if uncertainty increases.

## Operational risk
- Validate data freshness.
- Alert on missing lineups, missing odds, or parse errors.
